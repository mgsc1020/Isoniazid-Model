The PBPK model for isoniazid was developed and verified with clinical pharmacokinetic data.

The model was built and evaluated covering clinical data from studies including in particular:

* intravenous administration from 5 mg/Kg to 10 mg/kg
* oral administration from 4.68 to 20 mg/kg as well as absolute doses of 300 mg - 900 mg po

The model describes isoniazid metabolism and urinary excretion.

The next sections show:

1. the final model input parameters for the building blocks: [Section 3.1](#31-isoniazide-final-input-parameters).
2. the overall goodness of fit: [Section 3.2](#32-isoniazide-diagnostics-plots).
3. simulated vs. observed concentration-time profiles for the clinical studies used for model building and for model verification: [Section 3.3](#33-concentration-time-profiles).
