The PBPK model for isoniazide was developed and verified with clinical pharmacokinetic data.

The model was built and evaluated covering clinical data from studies including in particular

* intravenous administration from 5 mg/Kg to 10 mg/kg
* oral administration from 4.75 to 20 mg/kg as well as absolute doses of 300 mg and 900 mg po

The model describes INH metabolism and its metabolites (AcINH, INA, INAG, AcHz, DiAcHz, and Hz), their metabolic reactions (NAT2INH,NAT2Hz, NAT2AcHz, NAAAINH, NAAAAcINH, GLYATINA), active transport reactions (SLC16A10INA, SLC16A10INAG), and urinary excretion reactions (INH, AcINH, INA, INAG, Hz, AcHz, and DiAcHz).

The next sections show:

1. the final model input parameters for the building blocks: [Section 3.1](#31-isoniazide-final-input-parameters).
2. the overall goodness of fit: [Section 3.2](#32-isoniazide-diagnostics-plots).
3. simulated vs. observed concentration-time profiles for the clinical studies used for model building and for model verification: [Section 3.3](#33-concentration-time-profiles).
