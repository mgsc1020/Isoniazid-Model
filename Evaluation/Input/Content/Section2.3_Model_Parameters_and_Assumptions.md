### Absorption <a id="model-parameters-and-assumptions-absorption"></a>

The parameter value for  `Specific intestinal permeability` and `Intestinal Paracellular permeability` were optimized based on clinical oral data, see [Section 2.3.4](#model-parameters-and-assumptions-identification). The measured solubility in FaSSIF was used in the model (see [Section 2.2.1](#invitro-and-physico-chemical-data))

The dissolution of tablets was implemented via empirical Weibull dissolution. 

### Distribution <a id="model-parameters-and-assumptions-distribution"></a>

Furosemide is highly bound to plasma proteins (see [Section 2.2.1](#invitro-and-physico-chemical-data)). A value of fu = 2.2% was used in this PBPK model for `Fraction unbound (plasma, reference value)`. The major binding partner was set to albumin (see [Section 2.2.1](#invitro-and-physico-chemical-data)).

An important parameter influencing the resulting volume of distribution is lipophilicity. The reported experimental logP ranged from -0.24 to 2.56, and a value of -0.24 was used in this model (see [Section 2.2.1](#invitro-and-physico-chemical-data)). 

After testing the available organ-plasma partition coefficient and cell permeability calculation methods built in PK-SimÂ®, observed clinical data was best described by choosing the partition coefficient calculation by `Schmitt` and cellular permeability calculation by `Charged dependent Schmitt`.

### Metabolism and Elimination <a id="model-parameters-and-assumptions-metabolism"></a>

One metabolic pathway was implement into the model via Michaelis-Menten kinetics 

* UGT1A9

The UGT1A9 expression profiles are based on high-sensitive real-time RT-PCR ([Nishimura 2006](#5-references)). Metabolic enzyme activity was described as saturable process following Michaelis-Menten kinetics, were the `Km` was taken from literature and the `kcat` was optimized based on clinical data (see [Section 2.3.4](#model-parameters-and-assumptions-identification)).

And several transport protein was implemented into the model via Michaelis-Menten kinetics 

* OAT3

The OAT3 expression profiles are based on high-sensitive real-time RT-PCR ([Nishimura 2005](#5-references)). Transporter activity was described as saturable process following Michaelis-Menten kinetics, were the `Km` was taken from literature and `kcat` was optimized based on clinical data (see [Section 2.3.4](#model-parameters-and-assumptions-identification)).

* MRP4

The MRP4 expression profiles are based on high-sensitive real-time RT-PCR ([Nishimura 2005](#5-references)). Transporter activity was described as saturable process following Michaelis-Menten kinetics, were the `Km` was taken from literature and `kcat` was optimized based on clinical data (see [Section 2.3.4](#model-parameters-and-assumptions-identification)).

Additionally, passive renal clearance by glomerular filtration was implemented and the `GFR fraction` was set to 1. In addition, fraction of bile that was continuously released was set to 1 (`EHC continuous fraction`)
